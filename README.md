# Diamond Price Prediction 
This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on various attributes such as carat weight, cut, clarity, color, and depth. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the price of a diamond given its characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e8/data?select=train.csv(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e8/data?select=train.csv). It contains information about various diamonds, including their attributes and corresponding prices. The dataset is provided in csv format and can be found in the data directory.

## Installation
To run the project locally, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
The results of the diamond price prediction are evaluated based on various metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score. These metrics provide insights into the performance of the model and how well it predicts diamond prices.
